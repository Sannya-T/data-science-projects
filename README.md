Hello to you :-) , 
Here I present you my small portfolio of projects that I have been brought to realize during my year at the engineering school of physics of Clermont-Ferrand as a student in data science. I've done :
* Machine learning
* Deep Learning
* Data mining
* Data analysis using Python
* Advanced statistics
* Times series

Also, I took part into a tutored project in partnership with the Institut Pascal on food resilience with in particular the elaboration of a cartography of competences from the open data of PÃ´le emploi and INSEE and the cartography of life basins and small food producers...

I am currently taking the Machine Learning Engineer course at OpenClassrooms during which I will be required to carry out the following projects:
* Design an application for public health using dimensionality reduction tools 
* Anticipate the consumption needs of buildings.
* Segment customers of an e-commerce site to optimize communication campaigns
* Automatically categorize questions by developing a system to automatically tag user questions.
* Classify images using Deep Learning algorithms Learning algorithms
